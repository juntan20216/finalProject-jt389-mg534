# finalProject-jt389-mg534
Final Project for MATH 260 (Fall 2023) at Duke University, specifically implementing the Bellman-Ford Algorithm to detect aribtrage by finding negative cost cycles. 
Vertex and currencies class given, as well as the tests. 
We authored the Bellman-Ford Algorithm, which also includes the negative cost cycle detection.
