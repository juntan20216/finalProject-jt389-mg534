detectArbitrage
Performs the Bellman-Ford algorithm iteratively to detect negative cost cycles in a set of exchange rates
INPUTS
adjList: Adjacency list representing the currencies graph
adjMat: Adjacency matrix representing the exchange rates
tol: tolerance, checks every update step. If update is smaller than 1e-15, ignore.
OUTPUTS
An empty list if no vertex changed distance, 
OR the list that contains the negative cost cycle in proper order
